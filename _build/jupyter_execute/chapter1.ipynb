    "The Sun, our backyard star, is far more fascinating than it may appear in its first impression. Most of us believe it to be uninteresting because it is just an ordinary star among the billions of stars that we see in the night sky. However, the question is, if it is such a typical star, what makes it so fascinating? The brief answer is that it is the closest star to our home, i.e., the Earth, and it is the primary source of energy for the survival of living beings on this blue planet. The dependency of our life on this star for energy makes it necessary to study and at the same time exciting to know the future of this ordinary star. When we hear or see the word **Sun**, the first thing that pops up in our mind is a yellow star that rises in the East and sets in the West every day. Even though the Sun looks the same in the sky every day, but the importance of this yellow star did not remain hidden for long, and the curious minds started realizing it very early. Starting from the mythological story to the scientific quest, we have expanded our horizons beyond the limit to understand the Sun. Being the closest star to us provides an excellent opportunity to study it with enormous details. Moreover, it also serve as a laboratory for stellar physics to test their hypotheses and models. Throughout this thesis, we will try to get an even more comprehensive answer to what makes the Sun even more exciting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of the Sun is broadly classified into two classes, the short-term, where one studies the changes in Sun happening with the time scale of seconds to days, and the long-term, where the changes happening in the Sun over the years is studied. This thesis aims to understand the long-term behaviour of the Sun and how it can help our understanding of physics underneath. In this thesis, I will use the historical archival data as obtained from the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) and others, along with space-based data from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). Before I explain the details, let me start with our fundamental understanding of the Sun.\n",

    "- **Core:** This is the powerhouse of the Sun, which spans around $\\approx$20\\% its radius. This is the place where He, along with photons and neutrinos, are produced in _p-p_ chain reaction. In this region of the Sun, temperature varies from $\\approx$15~MK at its centre to $\\approx$10~MK at its edge. The energy produced in this reaction not only provides support against gravity but also gives the energy that we receive on the Earth. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Radiative Zone:** The layer next to the core, which extends from 0.2{{Rsun}} to 0.7 {{Rsun}}, where radiation is the energy transport mechanism, is called the radiative zone. The gamma photons produced in the _p-p_ reaction have to go through a random walk in this layer, and when it comes out of the Sun, it comes out as black body radiation peaking in the visible band. It takes around $1.7\\times 10^5$ years for a photon to come out of the Sun and only around 8 minutes to reach us.\n",

    "- **Tachocline:**  In helioseismology observations, a very thin layer of around 4% of the solar radius, at 7{{Rsun}}, has been discovered, which is called Tachocline {cite:t}`Charbonneau1999`. In this region as we move from radiative zone to convection zone, the rotation profile of the Sun changes from almost solid body to differential. Now, it is believed that the rapid change in the rotation could possibly has important implication to solar dynamo for the generation of a large scale magnetic field in the Sun {cite:p}`Miesch2005`, see  {cite:t}`Wright2016` for the more discussion about this layer.\n",

Here, the temperature is such that the electrons and nuclei start forming ions, leading to increased opacity and sufficient temperature gradient to start the convection. Here, the energy is transported via mass motion, which can be seen on the visible surface as granules.\n",

The advancement of instruments has enabled us to observe it even without the total solar eclipse, {numref}`fig1.2`(d) is one such example (AIA~94~\\AA). The extreme temperature, varying from a million kelvin to 10 MK, makes this region very interesting. The reason behind this unusual high temperature is still one of the outstanding problems of solar physics and known as the Coronal Heating problem. Apart from that, a frequent change in the magnetic topology makes this region very dynamic.\n",

It has been reported that the Chinese were the ones who first recorded these spots {cite:p}`Clark1978, Wittmann1987`, but the regular observation of these dark spots only started at the beginning of the 17th century by Galilee Galileo and Christoph Scheiner, just after Galileo's advent of the telescope. Even though the systematic observation of sunspots started so early, their physical nature was hidden to us till 1908. {cite:t}`Hale1908`, while working at Mount Wilson Observatory, by studying the Zeeman splitting of a spectral line {cite:p}`Zeeman1896`, discovered that these sunspots are the regions of the strong and concentrated magnetic field (see \\autoref{fig1.6}) with a typical field strength of $\\sim 10^3$~G, which can go up to 2000--3700~G {cite:p}`Solanki2003`.
