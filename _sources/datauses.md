# Data Uses

<div style="text-align: justify">

During different studies, presented in this thesis, I have used telescopic data from various space-based facilities. I duly acknowledge the data usage. I also want to thank the members and associates of these facilities for providing the data.
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) is a facility of Indian Institute of Astro- physics (IIA), Bangalore, India. This data is now available for public use at [http://kso.iiap.res.in](http://kso.iiap.res.in) through a service developed at IUCAA under the Data Driven Initiatives project funded by the National Knowledge Network (NKN).


SOHO is a project of international cooperation between ESA and NASA. SDO Data supplied courtesy of the SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA consortia. SDO is the first mission to be launched for NASAâ€™s Living With a Star (LWS) Program.
